# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm test                       # Unit tests (node:test)
node --test tests/hex-board.test.js  # Single unit test
npm run test:e2e               # Playwright E2E lifecycle tests
npm run test:e2e:airconsole    # Playwright E2E AirConsole tests
npm run test:visual            # Playwright visual snapshot tests
npm run test:visual:update     # Update snapshots after UI changes
```

## Key Rules

- After UI changes, run `npm run test:visual:update` and commit updated snapshots
- Engine modules (`server/*.js`) use UMD — must work in both Node.js and browser
- CSP headers in `server/index.js` — update when adding external resources
- Relay URL configured in `public/shared/protocol.js`
